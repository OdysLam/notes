- [[How to take Smart Notes]]
- When we take notes, we take them with the slip box in mind. Depending on the mental models that we have, notes can be longer or shorter as the context of a book can be already familiar to us. **A whole book can be summarised in a sentence**. 
- "The slip box is a tool to think **with**, **not in**. This means that it evolves alongside our knowledge and understanding, fitting perfectly to how our own minds work. "
